# IncrementalSave
A Blender add-on for auto-incremental saving of projects similar to Cinema4D.

## Installation

Download IncrementalSave.py from this repository to your hard drive. Launch Blender and navigate to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install Add-on and double-click on IncrementalSave.py. Make sure to click the check-box next to the name to activate it.

## Usage

Press CTRL+W.  Note: You must save the file once before you can incrementally save.

## Issues

Currently only supported on Windows (I believe). Tested in Blender 2.8+. Sometimes there is a file-system error that shows multiple leading backslashes in Blender's header bar, but doesn't affect functionality.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. This is my first add-on, so have at it.
