# IncrementalSave
A Blender add-on for auto-incremental saving of projects (like in Cinema4D and other software) created in Python 3.6.


## Installation

Download IncrementalSave.py from this repository to your hard drive. Launch Blender and navigate to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install Add-on and double-click on IncrementalSave.py.

## Usage

Press F3 while in the 3D viewport, type 'increme..' until you see "Incremental Save" and press "Enter". Note: You must save the file once before you can incrementally save.

## Issues

Currently only supported on Windows (I believe). Tested in Blender 2.8+. Sometimes there is a file-system error that shows multiple leading backslashes in Blender's header bar, but doesn't affect functionality.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. This is my first add-on, so have at it.
